# Product API with SQLite

This project demonstrates how to create a simple SQLite database, load sample product data, and query it using a Python script.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x installed on your Mac. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

## Setup Instructions

Follow these steps to set up the project:

### 1. Clone the Repository

If you haven't already, clone this repository or create a new directory for your project:

```bash
mkdir product_api
cd product_api
```

### 2. Create a Virtual Environment

Create a virtual environment to manage your project's dependencies:

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
```

### 3. Activate the Virtual Environment

Activate the virtual environment:

```bash
source venv/bin/activate
```

### 4. Create `requirements.txt`

Create a file named `requirements.txt` with the following content:

```
sqlite3
```

Note: The `sqlite3` module is included in Python's standard library, so you typically don't need to install it separately.

### 5. Create the Python Script

Create a file named `product_api.py` with the following content:

### 6. Run the Script

Make sure your virtual environment is activated, then run the script:

```bash
python product_api.py
```

### 7. Deactivate the Virtual Environment

When you're done, you can deactivate the virtual environment by running:

```bash
deactivate
```

## Conclusion

You have successfully set up a simple SQLite database and queried it using Python! Feel free to modify the sample data or expand upon this project as needed.
